* colorhunt-palettes-18-Jul-2020.json

15714 4-color palettes from colorhunt.co
Notes:
* Each palette is 4 colors, each 24-bit RGB
* I believe each RGB is a "standard" named color
* Scraped # of likes and date uploaded.  Could engineer "appeal" from some combination of "age" and likes
* Colors ordered per online visuals 
* Did not represent "weighting".  In the online palettes, color 1 has about 1.5x the weight of color 2, same for c2:c3, c3:c4
